# Alex's Home Assistant documentation

This website contains reference documentation to my Home Assistant installation. I will try and contain all my IMHO extensive Home Assistant knowledge within this repo. Hopefully it can be as a reference to you.

Issues, questions and pull requests are welcome!

## History

Before starting with Home Assistant in november 2018, I used a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) for a fairly simple home automation setup. Although it worked great, Domoticz was quite lacking with new integrations and updates. So I dived, head first into Home Assistant on version 0.81. 

The initial migration was quite tricky, but after a long week of trial and error, I haven't looked back since...

Since than I migrated to an Intel NUC like device, expanded my Z-Wave network and added Zigbee devices, contributed to Home Assistant and even created my own [Home Assistant add-ons](http://alxx.nl/hassio-addons).

## Hardware

Over the last few years I collected and succesfully implemented multiple devices which are essential to my home automation. I will try and list all of these devices and provide more information where necessary.

### Host system

Since my Raspberry Pi 3B+, I've migrated to a Intel NUC-like device, the [Gigabyte Brix GB-BLCE-4105](https://www.gigabyte.com/nl/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BLCE-4105-rev-10#ov). I've elaborated on why I chose this system and how to install this on a [dedicated page](hardware/host-system.md).
